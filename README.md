# Locust Detection with ML

Implement image recognition algorithms using ML techniques to identify locust swarms from aerial imagery.

* A suitable convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is chosen to develop the locust detection model. 

* Model Training: The selected model is trained using the curated dataset of locust images. The images are divided into training, testing and validation sets, and the model is trained using an appropriate loss function
